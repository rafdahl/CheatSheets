### Network Routers

* Contains networks
* Moves data between networks
* Connects dissimilar networks
* Software-based, feature rich

* **IOS**

* Internetwork Operating System

### Network WAP and Controller

* Wireless Access Point Translates wired into airwaves
* A whole new world of managing the unmanageable
* 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz Spectrums
  * lower the frequency, longer range, lower bandwidth
  * higher the frequency, smaller range, higher bandwidth
  * 2.4 has issues with lots of
* Controlling the minions
  * Helps mange larger amounts of WAPs
  * can auto adopt new APs and auto configure them

### Network Firewall / IPS

* Block or allow traffic from moving between networks
  * let the firewall be the firewall, and the router be the Router
  * Router allows everything, and denies by exception
  * Firewall denies everything, and allows by exception
* Transparent or routed
  * Transparent mode allows them to be run without being seen
  * routed divided up the networks
* Allow/deny paradigm shift... Key word: "Stateful"
  * firewall will let the internet in. but only by exception
* Integrated or separate intrusion prevention system (IPS)
  * Watches for abnormalities.

## The difference between bits and bytes

* Difference between storage and networks
  * Computers deal in bytes, networks deal in bits
* Networks can't actually send a byte of data
* Storage reaches into the tera / penta realm
* Networks reaches into the giga realm

* __Mbps__
* __Gbps__

* Internet and Wan always a bottleneck
* Computers = 100m, 1G
* 1G, 10G, 40G (EC)
  * EC - ether channel
  * can bundle up to 8 channels
* inter-switch link = 1G, 10G, 40G (EC)
  * CSMA/CD - Carrier Sense Multiple Access  Collision Detection
* Routers = 100m, 1G, 10G ()
* WAP
  * CSMA/CA Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance
  * TR uses old token ring technology
  * 5mbps - 60mbps

Bits and bytes
Kilo, Mega, Giga, and beyond

## Network Cabling

### Ethernet

* MDF
  * Main Distribution Facility
* IDF
  * Intermediary Distribution Facility
* DMARC
  * ISP responsibility to fix.
  * Could be Ethernet, Fiber Optic, and Serial...the Grandfather

## Defining a Network

### Defining the Network Neighborhood

* The network allows our computers to talk
  * the network allows Communication
* IP
  * the router provides boundaries
  * These boundaries provide different groupings
  * Without these boundaries, everything becomes mush.
* The network boundary - mask defined
* the first three octets represent the network
* Subnet purpose is to define the size of the network boundary
  * Where you see a 255 that represents a networks
  * Where you see a 0 that represents the host
* Devices that are grouped together that have the same network identifier as defined by the subnet mask.
* Class C Subnet
  * 255.255.255.0
  * gives you 254 host
* Class B subnet
  * 255.255.0.0
  * gives you 65,534 host
* Class A Subnet
  * 255.0.0.0
  * 16,777,214
* Smart Computers can reach other computers on that networks
  * the GW is what allows us to leave the internal network.
  * can decide which set of IPs it needs to access what it's trying to get too.
  * there is a need for 2 addresses

### Public and Private Addressing

#### Private IPv4 Address Ranges

RFC1918 name | IP address range | number of addresses
--- | --- |---
24-bit block | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 | 16,777,216
20-bit block | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 | 1,048,576
16-bit block | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 | 65,536
RFC - `Request for Comments Standard`

`Addresses inside of these private addresses won't be able to route on the internet`

`Every internet service provider they should put a firewall rule in place that prevents people with these addresses from getting out on the internet, because they are non-regulated IP addresses.`

### NAT

#### Network Address translation Description

* Translate private IP addresses to Public ones
* All private IPs assume the same Public IP
* Prohibiter of Innovation

## Gluing IP devices together

### DNS

* sends a get message, and assembles a packet
* get source IP header
* get destination IP header
* get source mac
* get destination Mac

__ the need for two addresses __

* MAC addresses
  * `Media Address Control`

### ARP

`Address Resolution Protocol`

* Sends out a broadcast message to the network to determine who is the IP address
* The switch looks at the MAC Addresses
* Switch will add the MAC to its CAM table

* Source IP is my IP
* Destination IP is where I'm wanting to go
* Source MAC is me
* Destination MAC is the default gateway

* Once it passes the network, the Source and Destination MAC address is ripped off

__ The front and end IP addresses stay the same.  __

## Selecting your Protocol

* __TCP__ `Transmission Control Protocol`
  * reliable network Communication
  * __3 way hand shake__
  * Session relationship
    * first: TCP SYN `Synchronization Message`
      * sends sequence number
    * SYN/ACK
    * ACK
  * This information is used until the connection is terminated

* __TCP Sliding Windows__
* It starts out by sending small amounts of data to test the connection and then continues to increase till something on the chain maxes out
* __UD__ `User datagram protocol`
  * unreliable network Communication
  * send in hope it gets there
* __ICMP__ `Internet Control Message Protocol`
  * Developed for controlled messages
  * `PING`
  * sends echo, and gets an echo reply

## Completing the End-to-end story

* __Wireshark is awesome__

## Tools you can't live Without

* __PING__
  * checks connections between Devices
  * ICMP Protocol

* __ARP__
  * tells you what IP is associated with what MAC address
  * arp -a to see the cache
  * arp -d * clears the cache

* __Telnet__
  * Management
  * Uses clear text to connected device
  * Check to see if ports are Open

* __PuTTy__
  * SSH
  * SecureCRT

__ipconfig/ifconfig__
__nslookup__

## Three Tier Architecture

* Core
  * Not necessary until you have multiple locations
  * Center point of cross connect
* Distribution layer
  * Routing
  * QOS
  * various over things as well
* Access layer Switch
  * `More of a framework and not like connections going everywhere`

## OSI Model

`where its at`

### What is the OSI Model

* A Standard Architecture defining network Communication
* A system to "Break Down" network Communication
  * You approach repair in a layers without thinking about it.
* A standard to create standards
  * People can create equipment to work at a particular layer and below.
* a competing protocol to TCP/IP
  * OSI was created as a competing protocol, however TCP won.
  * OSI was better, TCP was simpler

Layer | |What it does
:---: | :---: | ---
7 | `Application` | Where the network aware application resides (i.e. the web browser)
6 | `Presentation` | where the generic standards reside, uses generic encryption (i.e. html, jpeg, etc.)
5 | `Session` | Starts and ends the session between the server
4 | Transport | This layer has two major function, pick your protocol `(TCP/UDP)*` and pick your port `show it knows where to put the information`.
3 | Network | IP address End-to-end address, where it came from, where it's going `routing`
2 | Datalink | Adds the MAC address, Hop-to-hop `Switching`
1 | Physical | The cable that is in use

`The Computer - these layers are not a network engineers problem`

`* TCP reliability, UDP Speed`

This whole process is known as encapsulation.

## TCP/IP Model

### DOD Model

Layer | Description | OSI reference
--- | --- | :---:
4 | Application | OSI 5-7
3 | Transport | OSI 4
2 | Internet | OSI 3
1 | Network Access | OSI 1-2

__ About as useful as giving a snow cone to an Eskimo. __

## Encapsulation, frame Format, and Wireshark

2 |  GET   | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |2 |
:---: | :---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
FCS `Frame Check Sequence` | DATA | TCP/UDP Ports | SRC IP | DST IP | SRC MAC | DST MAC

### Configuring the Switch Management IP Address

#### Switch 1 & 2 Base Config

* en
* conf t
* hostname sw1
* ip domain-name ryanngay.com
* crypto key gen rsa
  * name `sw1.ryanngay.com`
  * 1024
* username ryan secret cisco
* line console 0
  * logging sync
  * no exec-time
  * exit
* line vty 0 4
  * login local
  * exec-timeout 60
  * transport input telnet ssh
  * exit
* no ip domain-lookup
* enable secret cisco
* exit
* int VLAN 1
  * no shutdown
  * `switch 1` ip address 10.1.1.2
  * `switch 2` ip address 10.1.1.3

#### Router Base Config

* en
* conf t
* hostname sw1
* ip domain-name ryanngay.com
* crypto key gen rsa
  * name `sw1.ryanngay.com`
  * 1024
* username ryan secret cisco
* line console 0
  * logging sync
  * no exec-time

  * transport input telnet ssh
  * exit
* no ip domain-lookup
* enable secret cisco
* exit
* int G0/0
  * ip address 10.1.1.1/24

## Speed and Duplex

* Network Speed Has Increased over Time
  * Ethernet= 10MBPS
  * Fast Ethernet= 100 MBPS `SPECIAL`
    * Auto `try to negotiate with the other side`
    * Didn't work quite right every time
    * when it doesn't work, one side will send and receive at the same time, the other side will only do one or the other.
    * The `Network Seems Slow`
  * Gigabit Ethernet= 1000 MBPS
    * Use Auto unless connected to a fast Ethernet, then hard code it
  * ...and Beyond
* And standards have changed...
  * Half Duplex
  * Full Duplex

### Hard code the interface

* On Key Fast Ethernet Devices, best practice recommends running these commands.
  * conf t
    * in fa -/-/-
    * speed 100
    * duplex full

## Switching Day to day

### Understanding Port Security

* The Purpose and Place of Port Security
  * We Care about things plugging into our network
    * We want to know when someone plugs something in
    * BYOD can cause your network to go down
  * Two types of security:
    1. (Everyone) Limit the number of mac addresses on each port
    2. (Security Centric) Limit what mac addresses can access the port
       * Statically configured
       * Sticky mac address
  * Three response types:
    * Protect
      * If limited to 1 mac address, and a second devices is plugged in, then the second device won't work.
    * Restrict
      * If limited to 1 mac address, and a second devices is plugged in, then the second device won't work. It will log the port security violation.
    * and Shutdown
      * Default State
* Implementing basic port security
  * Switch 1 Port Security Config
    * int range -/-/-
      * switchport mode access
      * switchport port-security maximum 1
      * do sh run int _-/-/
    * sh int port-security int _-/-/-
    * conf t
      * int _-/-/-
        * shutdown
        * no shutdown
        * switchport port-security
        * switchport port-security mac-address sticky
    * Re-enable a Port
      * shutdown
      * no shut
* Implementing Mac Address restrictions

### Handling "The Network is slow"

* How to tell is the network is slow `speedtest consistency, iperf`
  1. SpeedTest sites
     * <https://speedtest.net>
     * <https://speakeasy.net/speedtest>
     * <https://speedof.me>
  2. Watch speed and consistency of speed
  3. Internal testing - IPerf `client/server`
  4. Wired vs wireless - Never accept only a wireless test
  5. Know your baseline usage and bandwidth capacity
* Key interface counters
  * Trace the switchport path between source and destination
  * Use the `show interface` command to review statistics
    * `tx` send
    * `rx` receive
    * `runts` packet smaller than what's expected, it can be dropped
    * `giant` bigger than a packet should be, it will be dropped
  * Key "Performance" counters:
    * Duplex/Speed
    * 5 minutes output rates
    * Input errors
      * Some kind of cabling issue or bad interface
    * `CRC` Cyclical Redundancy check
      * `FCS` Frame Check Sequence
      * checks to make sure its valid
      * bad cable, bad interface, layer 1 issue
    * collision
      * Own collision domain
        * collision devices try to send when its not supposed too. Usually happens in a duplex mismatch
        * Causes major network issues
    * late collisions
      * Happens when a collision happens later than it should. CSMA/CD
      * Happens if its past the 32 bits of the frame
      * If the cable is to long, or if there are to many devices in between
    * interface resets
      * This will happen if to many errors build up in an attempt to reset the interface

## Switching VLANs

### The Concept that Changed the Networking World

* Understanding the Problem
  * There is virtually no security at Layer 2
  * There is no segmentation at layer 2
    * Led to the network slowing down drastically
  * There is no real way to differentiate devices at layer 2

#### QOS Recommendations

Service Type | Bandwidth Allocated
:---: | :---:
Voice | 33%
Mission Critical Data | 35%
Voice Signaling | 7%
Everything else | 25%

* Old School Solution
  1. Routers Everywhere
     * Every interface of a router is a subnet, it introduces a subnet
     * ACL Access Control List
     * Routers stop broadcasts
     * Routers are slow, causing them to be a bottle neck on the network
     * physical limitations
  2. Servers on Every Network

* The VLAN Solution `Virtual Local Area Network`
* VLANS segment the network on a per-port basis
  * VLANs create multiple broadcast domains/subnets/networks
    * Broadcasts will stay within the same VLAN
  * VLANs Extend the entire Layer 2 fabric (stop at router)
    * VLANs can be access across multiple switches
    * Trunks carry all VLANs across the switches
  * VLANs segment and isolate traffic

### Routing between VLANs

* Using a router
  * THe Old, but valid Possibility
  * Drawback
    * Limited number of Router Interfaces

* The Router on a Stick (ROAS)
  * Trunk Port
  * Sub interfaces
    * Allows us to take 1 interface, and split it into multiple interfaces
    * The Cloud, a bunch of data centers, ROAS

* Using a Layer 3 Switch
  * Combines the best of Routing and Switching, and puts them into one device.
  * Not a Frankenstein Device
  * Layer 3 Switching takes the core of Routing, and makes it ASIC `Application Specific Intergrated Circuitry` Based

### Trunking VLANS to other Switches

* Tagging Done Between Switches with 802.1q protocol
  * Industry Standard
  * ISL `Inner Switch Link`
* Tag removed on exiting `access port`
  * `Access Port` any non trunked interface
  * These devices access only one VLAN
* Trunk ports configured on each interface
  * If you aren't careful about which ports you trunk, and a user is plugged into a trunk port, they can do a VLAN Hopping Attack

* How the Dynamic Trunking Protocol Works
  * When a switch is plugged in, it builds trunk
  * When a computer is plugged in, it builds an access port
  * Enable Trunk Ports
    * Manual Configuration (Trunk/nonegotiate)
    * ~~Dynamic Configuration (Dynamic Auto/Dynamic Desirable)~~
  * Dynamic Configuration can be Creepy; Use Nonegotiate

* Trunk ports should receive traffic with tags
* but what is it doesn't? `Native VLAN`
  * Native VLAN is for when it receives traffic that doesn't have a tag attached to it
  * CDP
* But how?
  * Switchport Originated Traffic
  * Pass-through Device
  * Virtualized Servers

### The Weird and Scary World of VTP

* What is VTP
  * Conforms your network
  * Allows you to add a VLAN to 1 switch, and will replicate it to your other switches
  * Cisco Recommends you not use it
  * VTP REV #0
  * VTP Domain
  * Can take down the entire network
  * To fix the network down issues, you need to re-add the VLAN to change the VLAN Database
    * Client `Can't make changes to the databases`
    * Server `This is default`
    * Transparent `will turn this off`
  * Enabled by default, as soon as its plugged in, it will form the trunk, it will join the domain
  * Nightmare from a Security Perspective

### Configuring and Testing VLANs

```switch
Switch

conf t
  vlan 2
    name ACCT
    exit
  vlan 3
    name SALES
    exit
  int range _-/-/_-_
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 2
    exit
  int range _-/-/_-_
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 3
    exit
  int range _-/-/_-_
    spanning-tree portfast
```

When in **Configuration Mode** use the `do` command to drop down to privilege mode.

## Switch Troubleshooting

### Where to Look

* Scenario 1: Student Testing is not working
  * Classroom 1 seems to be broken, the other 4 classes are fine
  * `sh int status`
  * syslog
* Scenario 2: Accounting spreadsheets are an bearable
  * `clear counters int _-/-/-`
* Scenario 3: Public WiFi is down
  * `switchport trunk allowed vlan add _`
  * if you do not use add, you will remove the other VLANs

**SVI** `Switch Virtual Interface`

### DHCP in a Routed World

* Understanding DHCP, Client Requests, DHCP Options
  * Broadcast-based, Central IP distribution
    * **Broadcast** the router will stop it
  * Minimal Client Interaction
  * Assigns IP address and DHCP options
    * Option 1: Subnet Mask
    * Option 3: Router (Gateway)
    * Option 6: DNS Server(s)
    * ...and hundreds of others
  * Clients usually prefer the same IP
* How DHCP is Usually Handled
  * DHCP from a network device (same network)
  * DHCP relay from a central DHCP server
  * **DHCP is a critical service**
* Understanding DHCP Replay
  * configure the interface to DHCP relay at the ip address of that server
  * router converts the DCHP broadcast request, and sends it to the server as a Unicast

### What are Routing Protocols

* What is a Routing Protocol
  * A Router knows about **ONE** type of network by default
  * Routing Protocol: Educate a router without your involvement
    * RIP
    * BGP
    * EIGRP
    * ...many more
  * Routing Protocols are dynamic, forming neighbors, detecting failures
    * They use the **Hello** Protocol
* Distance Vector Attributes
  * Only Knows what the neighbor tells it
  * Memory / Processor Efficient
  * Loop Prevention Mechanisms Needed
    * RIP
    * EIGRP
    * BGP
* Link State Attributes
  * Maintains a map of the network system
  * Resource Consuming
  * Maintains Loop free by nature
    * OSPF
    * IS-IS

### Pick your flavor

`ICND 1, only need to know RIP`

* Yes... RIP is important (again)
  * Created in 1988 (v1)
    * broadcast based broadcast to share your routing table
  * 1993 (v2)
    * Made it to a multicast based protocol that would only send their information to other routers using RIP
    * Its achilleas heal was its **Metric** How does the routing protocol find the best way around the network.
    * **Metric** Uses Hop count
    * Would send the entire routing table with every hello
* IGRP
  * Uses bandwidth and delay on the links, That would be its Metric
  * Was meant to compete with RIP, Cisco Proprietary.
  * Took long to discontent
  * Would send the entire routing table with every hello
* EIGRP
  * Was Proprietary, but later released as an RFC open standard.
  * Talks the bandwidth and delay aspect of IGRP, and is lightning fast.
  * do an initial exchange, after that, now all it does is says hello
  * sub-second convergence
  * un-equal cost load balancing
* OSPF
  * Almost all the benefits of EIGRP
  * Most Popular, born to be an Standard
  * based off of bandwidth alone
  * uses a link state database
* IS-IS
  * back in the day there was TCP/IP and OSI
  * OSI Protocol created IS-IS
  * Internet Service Provider Networks only
  * Integrated IS-IS

* sh ip route
  * Shows only the best of the best in the routing table

### Understanding RIPv2

* Why v2? What happened to v1?
  * v1
    * Broadcast based protocol
    * one to all
    * could be a security vulnerably
  * v2
  * Multicast based protocol
  * one to a group
  * moves from a classful, to classless
* Tell your life in 30 seconds
* It's time to be a little classless...
  * class a 0-127 (255.0.0.0)
  * class b 128-191 (255.255.0.0)
  * class c 192-223 (255.255.255.0)
* Where does this protocol fit? Anywhere
  * slowest protocol
  * implement, monitor, troubleshoot a routing protocol
  * commands to know
    * `router rip`
    * `version 2`
    * `network`
      * tells rip what networks to advertise
      * tells rip what interfaces to send advertisements out of

* [Administrative Distance / Metric]
* `Adminstrative Distance` the lower the number, the more believable it is
* `Metric` it can get to the over network via hops, the lower the better
* Auto Summary

## IPv4 Subnetting

### Why are We Doing This

* Classful vs Classless World
  * IPv4 Address:
    * Example: 10.10.10.1
    * Four Octet (byte) Address
    * Can be one of three different classes
    * When combined with a subnet mask, defines a network and host portion
    * operates at Layer 3 of the OSI Model
    * Works closely with layer 2 address (hop-by-hop)
* The Need for Smaller and Bigger Chunks
  * Class A Private Range: Anything starting with 10
    * Example: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255/8
  * Class B Private Range: Anything Starting with 172.16
    * Example: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255/16
  * Class C Private Range: Anything Starting with 162.168
    * Example: 192.168.0.0 -192.168.255.255
  * We can define different entities of hosts as we customize each network
* What's it take?

  * Add /  When Finding Hosts

### Reverse Engineering a Subnet Problem

* Scenario 1:
  * IP: 192.168.1.127
  * Mask: 255.255.255.224
  * The subnet is broken
* Scenario 2:
  * IP 172.16.68.65
  * Mask: 255.255.255.240
  * GW: 172.16.68.62
    * Device has the wrong GW for its IP address

### Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)

* VLSM Scenario
  * Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 to Address this network. Use the most efficient addressing possible.
    * Router 1
      * 20 Users
    * Router 2
      * 20 Users
    * Router 3
      * 60 Users
    * Links between Router
      * 2 users per each link
        * 3 links in total
    * All Routers connected to each other.
  * Start with largest number of users
    * 60 Users
      * 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63/26
      * 255.255.255.192
    * 20 User Networks
      * 192.168.1.64 - 95/27
      * 192.168.1.96 - 127/27
    * 2 users
      * 192.168.1.128 - 131/30
      * 192.168.1.132 - 135/30
      * 192.168.1.136 - 139/30

## Access Lists

### How the Router Became a Firewall

* What is an Access List (ACL)
  * Most Successful hacking attempts come from the inside.
    * What they are: A list of Permit and Deny Statements
      * Permit 192.168.2.50
      * Deny 192.168.1.0/24
      * Permit TCP Port 80 for 200.1.1.1
      * Permit all TCP traffic for 210.0.1.0/24
* Alternative ACL Uses
  * What they can be used for
    * Access Control
    * NAT (Network Address Translation)
    * Quality of Service
    * Demand Dial Routing
    * Policy Routing
    * Route Filtering
    * Making French Toast
* The Rules Governing ACLS
  * Lists are read from Top to Bottom; stops at first match
    * Invisible implicit deny at the bottom
  * ACL is applied to an interface inbound or outbound
* Types of Access Lists
  * Standard Access Lists
    * Matches based on Source address
    * lower processor utilization
    * affect depends on application
  * Extended
    * Matches based on Source/Destination Address, Protocol, Source/Destination Port Number
    * Higher Processor utilization
    * Syntax takes some time to learn
  * Reflexive (Established)
    * Allows return traffic for internal Requests

`ip access-list standard __NAME__`
Allows for named access lists instead of numbers

### Configuring Standard Access Control Lists

* Standard ACL Scenario #1

```text
R1
  conf t
    ip access-list standard SCENARIO1
      deny 10.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 / deny host 10.1.1.1
      permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 / permit any
    int s0/0 ip access-group SCENARIO1 in
```

* Standard ACL Scenario #2

```text
R1
  conf t
    ip access-list standard SCENARIO2
      deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.127
      permit any
    int g0/0
      ip access-group SCENARIO2 out
```

* Standard ACL Scenario #3

```text
R3
  conf t
    access-list 50 deny 192.168.2.50 0.0.0.0
    access-lsit 50 permit any
```

* Bonus

```text
conf t
  ip access-list standard FILTER_TELNET
    permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
  line vty 0 4
    access-class FILTER_TELNET in
```

* If used for security, apply it as close to the destination as possible.

* You can change the sequence number in the list. This tells it how to execute.

## Network Address translation

### Technology Overview

* What is NAT?
  * Internet = Big Network
  * Too many devices compared to the number of total IP addresses
  * IP management necessary
  * Public and Private Divide Needed
  * Welcome to NAT!
* How NAT Works
  * Originally it was a one to one mechanism
    * This form of NAT is Commonly called PAT (Port Address Translation)
    * PAT
        |Inside Address | Outside Address
        :---:|:---|
        192.168.1.50:6711 | 200.1.1.1:6711
        192.168.1.51:1536 | 200.1.1.1:1536
    * Allows you to over load a single public address, so it can service multiple private interfaces
    * Can see that using `netstat`
    * number of ports available `65,536`
    * `Socket` when the ip address and port are placed together
    * Will translate the port (PAT)
  * Static NAT
    * Static NAT can translate full IP Addresses or Specific Ports
      * Inside Address | Outside Address
        :---:|:---:
        192.168.1.50:6711 | 200.1.1.1:6711
        192.168.1.51 | 200.1.1.2
      * Static NAT are usually for incoming connection
      * Can take 1 ip address and carve it up to send it to multiple internal devices
  * Dynamic NAT

### Configuring NAT Overload

1. Assign IP addresses and connect devices as shown. The computers can be configured via DHCP or statically.
    * Internet 200.1.1.1/24 from G0/1
    * Router to switch 192.168.1.0/24 from G0/0
2. Configure a default
    1. Create ACL to ID Addresses to b e translated
    2. Identify the inside and outside interfaces
    3. Define NAT Operations
    4. ```text
       How to configure NAT Overload
        reload in ?
        ip access-list standard NAT_ADDRESSES
          permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
          exit
        int g0/0
          ip nat inside
          exit
        int g0/1
          ip nat outside

        ip nat inside source list NAT_ADDRESSES interface g0/1 overload

        sh ip nat translation

        ip nat pool SNUGGLES 200.1.1.2 200.1.1.5 prefix-length 24

        ip nat inside source list NAT_ADDRESSESS pool SNUGGLES overload
       ```

### Configuring Static NAT

```text
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.50 200.1.1.10

ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.1.51 80 200.1.1.11 80
ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.1.51 443 200.1.1.11.443
```

## IPv6

### Welcome to the New addressing world

* Will we ever need to upgrade to IPv6 ?!?
  * Yes, Virginia...there is an IP address shortage!
  * Current IP addresses poorly allocated
  * New network devices on the rise
  * NAT (Our Current Solution) is now seen as a hindrance to innovation
  * Potential future features: IPSEC Everywhere, Mobility, Simpler Header
* IPv6 Addressing Format
  * Address Size moved from 32 bit (IPv4) to 128 bit (IPv6)
  * Provides...many many many ...addresses
  * To make addresses more manageable, divided into 8 groups of 4 hex characters
  * Rule 1: eliminate groups of consecutive zeros
    * Can only be used once
  * Rule 2: Can drop leading zeros in hextet

### New Communication and Address Types

* IPv4
  * Unicast
  * Broadcast
* IPv6
    Cast | Types of Addresses | meaning
    :---|---|---
    Unicast: one-to-one | Link-Local Scope Address: Layer 2 Domain | used for local communication on that network
    Multicast: one-to-many | Unique/Site-local scope address: Organization | no one uses the standard Private Address
    Anycast: one-to-closest | Global Scope Address: Internet

  * Multicast
    * FF02::1:2 reaches all dhcp tables
    * arp replaced by neighbor-discovery

  * Link-local
    * Similar to the 169.254.X.X addresses of IPv4
    * Always begins with "FE80" (First 10 bits: 111 1110 10) followed by 54 bits of Zeros
    * Last 64 bits is the 48 bit mac address with "FFFE" squeezed in the middle
    * EUI-64 Addressing
    * Microsoft uses privacy extension

  * Global Address
    * Have their high-level 3 bits set to 001 (2000::/3)
    * Global Routing prefix is 48 bits or less
    * Subnet ID is comprised of Bits are left over after global routing prefix
    * The primary addresses comprising the IPv6 internet are from 2001::/16
      * /32 subnets assigned to providers
      * /48, /56, /64 subnets assigned to customers

  * No longer tied to a carrier for your IP addresses (Provider Independent)
  * IPv4 is Provider Affiliated

### Client Addressing

* The Kinds of Addresses a Client can get
  * Global
    * Public Addresses (Internet 2)
    * 2XXX::
  * Link Local
    * Generated Automatically (`EUI64` FFFE)
  * Unique Local
    * Optional
    * We can route these without any connection to the internet
  * Multicast
    * Group Addressing
  * Anycast
    * Same IP address on multiple server
    * One-to-closest
* How the client can get those addresses
  * 1 Hextet = 16 bits
  * Static Addressing: What it always has been
  * DHCPv6: What is always has been (Multicast-Powered)
    * If it starts with `FF02` it is a Multicast Device
  * SLACC: Stateless Address Auto Configuration
    * Dynamically asks router to discover network (ICMP Workhorse)
    * Generates host portion of the address (Relying on DAD)
      * `DAD` Duplicate Address Detection

### Interface Configuration and Static Routes

1. Assign IP addresses and connect devices as shown
   * ```text
     R1
     sh ip int br
     conf t
      ip routing
      no ip routing
      ip routing
      ipv6 unicast-routing
      int s0/0/0
        ipv6 address 2001:210:10:1::1/64
        no shutdown
     sh ip int br
     sh ipv6 int br

     R2
      conf t
        ipv6 unicast-routing
        int s0/0/0
          ipv6 address 2001:210:10:1::2/64
          no shutdown
     ```
2. Test by pining between the two devices
   * Pings are fully functional at this point.
   * ping ipv6
3. Configure a static route allowing the two LAN connections to reach each other
   * ```text
     R2
     conf t
      int loopback 0
        ipv6 address 2001:56::1
        no shutdown
        exit
      ipv6 route 2001:55::0/64 2001:210:10:1::1

     R1
     conf t
      int loopback 0
        ipv6 address 2001:55::1
        no shutdown
        exit
      ipv6 route 2001:56::0/64 2001:210:10:1::2
     ```
4. Test using ping sourced from each LAN Interface of the Routers
   * ping ipv6 `follow prompt`

* loopback which is online and access able as long as the router is running
  * Great for emulation networks

## Device Management

### Logging via Syslog

* The Beauty of Syslog
  * `FACT:` Most Network engineers do not implement comprehensive logging
  * Syslog Message Format:
    * ```text
      conf t
        logging console
      for vty
        terminal monitor

      logging host X.X.X.X
      ```
  * Key Practices:
    * Use the same IOS Version (Different Messages, Severity)
    * Out of band management (Security, Performance)
    * Centralized Logging Server (Splunk, Syslog, etc)
* Implementing a Small Syslogging Environment
  * Syslog Captures key status messages

### Backing Up and Restoring the IOS and configuration

* Understanding File Storage Locations
  * Cisco Devices have multiple  storage locations where they can access files
    * Flash
      * IOS
    * RAM
      * Running config
    * NVRAM
      * Config
  * Copy command allows you to perform file management between locations
    * HTTP
    * FTP
      * Login Required
    * TFTP
      * UDP
      * No login

* Access the device shown in the picture
* Backup the IOS to the TFTP server shown
* Backup the running config to the TFTP Server
* Restore the IOS and running config to the router the proper way

```text
copy flash:FILE_NAME tftp://X.X.X.X/FILE_NAME

copy running-config tftp:

copy startup-config tftp

copy tftp flash

copy tftp startup-conf

sqeeze flash
```

### The Network Time Protocol (NTP)

* What is the Network Time Protocol
  * Keeps Cisco Clocks in Synchronized (no clock drift), Valuable For:
    * Log Files
    * Certificates
    * ...much more
  * Set in Three ways
    * Poll an NTP Server (Typically and NTP Client)
    * Listen to NTP Multicasts
    * Listen to NTP Broadcasts
* Configure NTP Server Polling
  * ```text
    clock set

    conf t
      clock timezone CENTRAL -?
      ntp server X.X.X.X
      do sh clock
    ```

### Password Recovery

* Security, Step 1: Door, Lock, and Key
* Password Recovery Walkthrough
  * How a Cisco Device Boots
    * Check the configuration register
      * sh version
    * Check for "boot system" commands in the startup   config
    * Look for the first IOS Image in flash
    * Broadcast for TFTP Server
  * ```text
    copy start run
    conf t
    config-register 0x2142
    ```
  * Use rommon to get set the configuration-register
    ```text
    control break
    confreg 0x2142
    reset

    copy startup running
    enable secret cisco
    exit
    wr mem
    config-register 0x2102
    ```
  * 2102 normal startup
  * 2142 initial config mode
